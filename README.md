### To-do:
- Data Storage w/ SQL
- Finalize Color schemes

## Problems Faced
- a disappearing navigation bar: the background and foreground were set to the same color
- a scaling problem
- a gradle mess: gradle rewrites itself in every device, but rewrites wrong about 60% of the time
- _json_: very very important for firebase!
- a gradle mess, pt.2 (_local.properties deleted? huh??_): configuration files delete themselves for no reason
- a library unmaintained: library source code is not compilable with the new version of Android Studio causing major issues when running code
