# Athena Productivity
Athena’s team is where aesthetic design meets serious getting-things-done. We built an Android app with (mostly) everything: airtight security (we're talking encryption: yes we had to learn how to do that), cloud storage, chatting with your bestie while being "productive" (scrolling on reels with your laptop open), task lists that actually get checked off, notes you’ll actually read later, and graphics with just the right amount of pixels.

So, why settle for “just productivity” when you can have ATHENA PRODUCTIVITY? A bold new way to task—because multitasking deserves a little flair.

## Progress
### Completed: 
- Calendar
- Firebase User Profiles
- To-do List (UI + Local Data, Firebase Data integration for storage)
- Chat Feature (UI + Firebase Data integration, Storing Chat Data + handling group chats w/ unique user IDs)
- Calendar (sync with to-do list based on due dates)
- Home page
- Color theme toggles

## Problems Faced
- a disappearing navigation bar: the background and foreground were set to the same color
- a scaling problem
- a gradle mess: gradle rewrites itself in every device, but rewrites wrong about 60% of the time
- _json_: very very important for firebase!
- a gradle mess, pt.2 (_local.properties deleted? huh??_): configuration files delete themselves for no reason
- a library unmaintained: library source code is not compilable with the new version of Android Studio causing major issues when running code
