- Task: Task data type; implements TaskOutline; currently stores Task Name, Details, Due date and due time
- TaskFragment: Fragment that shows all the tasks (was previously an activity called TaskView)

- TaskManager: global task storage (TO-DO: STORE THIS DATA!)
- TaskDataStructure: using TreeSet (Red-Black BST under the hood) to store tasks
