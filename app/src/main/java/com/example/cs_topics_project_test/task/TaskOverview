Task Data Type
- TaskOutline: Interface for Task data type
- Task: Task data type; implements TaskOutline; currently stores Task Name, Details, Due date and due time
- TaskDetail: value in TreeSet that stores only task's name and description
- Task Completed: Data type for completed tasks; used to completed task TreeSet and Adapter for viewing

Task Data Structure
- TaskManager: local task management using Mutable Lists to make viewing tasks quicker for the user
- TaskDataStructure: global task storage using TreeSet (Red-Black BST under the hood) to store all tasks

Task Middle-man
- Task Listener: interface that facilitates communication between Task Adapters, View Models, and Data Structures

Task View Models and Core functionality
- TaskFragment: fragment that shows all the tasks categorized as past due, due today, due later and completed (was previously an activity called TaskView)
- TaskActivity: activity that adds tasks to global data structure (TreeSet implementation in TaskDataStructure) and updates stored local data (Multiple Mutable Lists in TaskManager); Newly added tasks are shown inside the activity until page reloads/exits

Task Adapters
- TaskAdapterActivity: used for showing tasks recently added in TaskActivity
- TaskAdapterCompleted: used for showing completed tasks in a different style than scheduled tasks in TaskFragment
- TaskAdapterList: dynamically shows tasks to-do in TaskFragment
- CalendarAdapter: dynamically changes and shows tasks that are scheduled for a selected day
