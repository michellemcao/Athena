Task Data Type
- TaskOutline: Interface for Task data type
- Task: Task data type; implements TaskOutline; currently stores Task Name, Details, Due date and due time
- TaskDetail: value in TreeSet that stores only task's name and description

Task Data Structure
- TaskManager: local task management using Mutable Lists to make viewing tasks quicker for the user
- TaskDataStructure: global task storage using TreeSet (Red-Black BST under the hood) to store tasks

Task Functionality
- TaskFragment: Fragment that shows all the tasks categorized as past due, due today, due later and completed (was previously an activity called TaskView)
- TaskActivity: Activity that adds tasks to global data structure (TreeSet implementation in TaskDataStructure) and updates stored local data (Multiple Mutable Lists in TaskManager); Newly added tasks are shown inside the activity until page reloads/exits
- TaskListAdapter: dynamically shows tasks added in TaskActivity and TaskFragment
